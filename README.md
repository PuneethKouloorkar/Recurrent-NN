Class assignment problem

I/p data: 
train_x and train_y: 400 labelled (0,1,2,3,4) sequences, each of length 400 characters.
val_x and val_y: 100 labelled sequences with 1200 characters each.

Test the model on test_x:
250 unlabeled sequences, each 2000 characters long.

Points awarded on accuracy of test_x:
accuracy points
≥ 95% = 10,
≥ 90% = 7,
≥ 85% = 5
